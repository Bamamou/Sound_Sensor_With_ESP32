+ The sound level from the sensor is used to trigger the LED to turn On or OFF
+ The simulation is availbe at https://wokwi.com/projects/358379202260047873
+ The sensor can be gotten form https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Sensor-Module-Detect-Control/dp/B00LW14ZEI/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?keywords=sound+sensor&qid=1678036429&sr=8-5
